# Elon Musk – Research Notes

## Early Life & Education

Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. He was born to Maye Musk, a Canadian model and nutritionist, and Errol Musk, a South African engineer, pilot, and property developer. His family background includes notable figures such as his grandfather Joshua N. Haldeman, who was the first chiropractor in Canada.

Musk's childhood was marked by both privilege and significant challenges. His parents divorced when he was eight years old, after which he primarily lived with his father—a relationship he later described as difficult and abusive. As a child, Musk was quiet, introverted, and highly intelligent, with a photographic memory. He spent much of his time reading encyclopedias and comic books, developing an early fascination with science fiction and technology.

Musk faced considerable social difficulties during his school years, including being severely bullied. Despite these challenges, his intellectual curiosity flourished. His interest in computing began when his father bought him a computer, leading him to teach himself programming. By age 12, he had created and sold a video game called "Blaster" for $500, showing early signs of his entrepreneurial spirit.

His formal education began at Waterkloof House Preparatory School, followed by Bryanston High School, and finally Pretoria Boys High School. To avoid mandatory military service in apartheid-era South Africa, Musk obtained a Canadian passport through his mother and moved to North America in 1989. He initially worked on farms and in lumber yards in Canada before enrolling at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, in 1990.

In 1992, Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned dual bachelor's degrees: a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor of Science in Physics. During his college years, he gained practical experience through internships at Silicon Valley startups, including Pinnacle Research Institute and Rocket Science Games.

Although accepted into Stanford University for a Ph.D. in Physics in 1995, Musk left after just two days, drawn by the emerging internet boom and his entrepreneurial ambitions. This decision marked the beginning of his remarkable business career.
