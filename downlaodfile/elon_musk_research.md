## Early Life and Education

Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. He was born to Maye Musk, a Canadian model and nutritionist, and Errol Musk, a South African engineer, pilot, and property developer.

Musk's childhood was characterized by a voracious appetite for reading and an early fascination with computers and technology. As a child, he was described as quiet and nerdy, spending much of his time consuming encyclopedias and science fiction novels, which fueled his imagination and interest in space and science.

Despite his intellectual pursuits, Musk faced significant social challenges. He was bullied extensively during his school years, including being thrown down stairs and physically assaulted, which contributed to his feelings of being an outsider. His early years were also marked by family difficulties; his parents divorced when he was eight, and he chose to live with his father, Errol Musk, a decision Musk later described as a mistake due to his father's abusive behavior.

### Education Pathway

Musk's formal education began in South Africa, where he attended:
- Waterkloof House Preparatory School
- Bryanston High School
- Pretoria Boys High School

His academic performance was solid, particularly in science and mathematics, but he was not considered an exceptional student academically. His passion for computers was evident early; at age 12, he created and sold a video game called Blastar for $500.

Seeking to avoid mandatory military service in South Africa and to pursue greater opportunities, Musk obtained a Canadian passport through his mother in 1988. He moved to Canada in 1989, where he enrolled at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. After two years, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where he earned dual bachelor's degrees in physics and economics in 1997. During his time at Penn, Musk completed internships at Silicon Valley startups, including Pinnacle Research Institute and Rocket Science Games, which further nurtured his interest in technology and entrepreneurship.

In 1995, Musk was accepted into Stanford University's Ph.D. program in physics. However, he dropped out just two days after starting, driven by his entrepreneurial ambitions and the burgeoning potential of the internet. This decision marked a pivotal turning point, leading him to establish Zip2, his first startup, which provided online city guides for newspapers and was later sold to Compaq for nearly $300 million.

## Early Career and Business Ventures

Elon Musk's entrepreneurial journey began in 1995 when he co-founded **Zip2** with his brother Kimbal Musk. Zip2 was an online city guide software company that provided content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. The company struggled initially, with Musk reportedly living in the office and showering at the YMCA. However, his persistence paid off when Compaq acquired Zip2 in 1999 for over $300 million, earning Musk approximately $22 million from the sale at the age of 27.

With his newfound capital, Musk quickly moved on to his next venture. In 1999, he founded **X.com**, one of the world's first online banks. The company was revolutionary in its approach to online financial services, offering a range of banking features that were uncommon at the time. 

### X.com and the Formation of PayPal

X.com merged with Confinity in 2000, a company founded by Peter Thiel and Max Levchin that had created a money transfer service called PayPal. The merged entity adopted the PayPal name, focusing on the growing potential of digital payments. Musk served as CEO until September 2000, when he was replaced by Peter Thiel during a period when Musk was on vacation. Despite this leadership change, Musk remained a major shareholder and influential figure in the company.

## PayPal

PayPal revolutionized online payments by creating a secure, user-friendly platform for transferring money electronically. Under Musk's initial leadership and continued influence, the company developed many features that are now standard in digital payment systems.

In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. As the company's largest shareholder at the time, Musk received approximately $180 million from the sale. This substantial windfall provided him with the capital to pursue his more ambitious ventures in space exploration and sustainable energy.
